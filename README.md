# 517_Heston_Prediction_Project
This project examines whether short-horizon volatility direction can be predicted with enough consistency to be useful in trading or risk systems. Using 100,000 Heston-simulated price paths and an 80/20 train–test split, we evaluate a range of machine learning models, contrasting traditional tree-based classifiers with sequence-aware neural networks that process returns as time-dependent signals. The problem proves intentionally hostile: stochastic volatility generates low signal relative to noise, and baseline models remain close to random classification accuracy. Recurrent architectures, however, show measurable lift, with AUC scores reaching the 0.57–0.61 range. While the improvements are modest, they highlight that temporal models extract structure that static models miss. In practical settings where small edges accumulate—options pricing, hedge calibration, and short-term volatility management—such incremental gains remain economically meaningful.
